# Final Summary

## Goal

Implement the first safe slice of the Strategy Idea Candidate Generation Pipeline: candidate-set contract, Python validation, deterministic JSON/Markdown writer, input-evidence blocking, shortlist export sidecar, docs, and focused tests.

## Branch

`ai/strategy-idea-candidates-20260627-1116`

## Achieved

- Added `strategy_idea_candidate_set.v1` JSON Schema and Pydantic models.
- Added `strategy_idea_candidate_export_manifest.v1` sidecar manifest schema and models.
- Added validation for count mismatch, selected/rejected ID mismatch, selected-only inventory, non-PASS input evidence, missing source summaries, sealed-test selection, and paper/live/auto-promote/final boundary flags.
- Added deterministic candidate-set JSON/Markdown writer.
- Added blocked input-evidence candidate set builder for non-PASS input contract validation.
- Added shortlist export to strict `strategy_idea.v1` draft JSON while keeping candidate set path/hash in the sidecar manifest.
- Added tests for schema validation, Python invariant validation, writer determinism, export, and intake validation integration.
- Added docs for the implemented candidate contract and corrected the checkpoint doc so C3 starts with canonical JSON/Markdown only.

## Main Files Changed

- `schemas/strategy_idea_candidate_set.v1.schema.json`
- `schemas/strategy_idea_candidate_export_manifest.v1.schema.json`
- `src/sis/strategy_idea_candidates/`
- `tests/strategy_idea_candidates/`
- `docs/strategy_idea_candidates/README.md`
- `docs/plans/strategy_idea_candidates_p0a_c2_c3_c8_2026-06-27.md`
- `docs/STRATEGY_IDEA_CANDIDATE_PIPELINE_CHECKPOINTS_2026-06-27.md`
- `README.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`
- `scripts/check_current_docs.py`

## Verification Run

- `uv run pytest tests/strategy_idea_candidates`
- `uv run ruff check src/sis/strategy_idea_candidates tests/strategy_idea_candidates`
- `uv run ruff format --check src/sis/strategy_idea_candidates tests/strategy_idea_candidates`
- `uv run python scripts/check_current_docs.py`
- `uv run python scripts/check_cli_catalog.py`
- `git diff --check`
- `./scripts/check`

## Not Run

None for this slice.

## Remaining Work

- C4 deterministic generator.
- JSONL / CSV search ledger rows after generator output exists.
- C5 split engine beyond policy records.
- C6 selection-adjusted metrics beyond `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.
- C9 Strategy Lab / backtest bridge.
- C10 dedicated operator review surface.
- Public CLI after writer/export behavior is stable.

## User Decisions Required

None for this slice.

## Destructive Change

No.

## Destructive Change Reason

Not applicable.

## Dependency Change

No dependency change. `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` were not modified.

## Migration

No migration is required.

## Rollback

Revert the new `strategy_idea_candidates` package, candidate schemas, tests, docs, and `scripts/check_current_docs.py` routing additions.

## Next Considerations

Start C4 only after agreeing on deterministic family templates, candidate cap, parameter grid shape, and duplicate rejection reason vocabulary.
